# OctoRelay
A plugin that adds buttons to the navigation bar to toggle GPIO pins on the Orange Pi.

This Plugin is forked from the original OctoRelay Plugin by borisbu (https://github.com/borisbu/OctoRelay) thanks ;-)

I use it with a 4 relay board, and printed this case for it:

just hooked up the GPIO pins with the relay board, and now I can turn the power of the printer, the fan and the light on and foo with OctoPrint.

## Setup
Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

## Configuration
![Settings panel](img/settings.png)

Curently, OctoRelay supports up to 8 relays:


| key | value |
|--|--|
| Relay X active | if true, this relay is active. If false, it will disappear in the settings and the navigation bar |
| GPIO Number | the GPIO pin on the Raspberry pi (see the picture above) |
| On on boot | if ticked this pin will be set to ON on start |
| Inverted output | if ticked the output on the pin is inverted (ex. relays is ON if GPIO pi is GND and OFF if GPIO pin is 3.3V) |
| Icon On | piece of html output if the relay is ON (can be text, img...)|
| Icon Off | piece of html output if the relay is OFF |
| Label | the html title of the icon in the navbar (text if you hover the icon) |
| Confirm | if ticked, a confirmation dialog shows before turning the relay off |
| Auto ON/OFF |  |
| Auto ON before printing | Turn the relay automatically ON if a print starts |
| Auto OFF after print finishes | Turn the relay OFF after a print finishes |
| Auto OFF delay | Wait for X seconds before turning OFF the relay automatically. For exampe for a fan that should run a bit longer |
